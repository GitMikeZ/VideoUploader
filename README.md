# Angular-Wistia-Video-Uploader-Component
 
 This app uses Angular 1 coded controller, component, and provider as a module component to upload videos from your device and embeds them for display. Each video is uploaded to Wistia's video hosting platform via their API and displays a progress bar to show the stages of upload progression via the jQuery-File-Upload by blueimp. In addition, the app uses jQuery and bootstrap to for angular functionality and formatting.
 
The app also has unit tests for the controller using Jasmine.
